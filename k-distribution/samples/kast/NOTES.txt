* Additional checks the KAST parser should do
** Each proper (i.e., non-subsort) production should have precisely one klabel attribute
** Only klabels defined as above or defined independently can be used in rules
** All occurrencies of all variables are sorted
** All "requires" commands and all "imports" statements are explicitly listed.
   Exception makes the syntax of K/KAST itself, which we will assume is included
   automatically.  The reason we do that is because we do not want it to interfere
   with the syntax that the program parser will use to parse programs.
** One has to handle oneself constant productions that one wants to link to tokens ... ???
